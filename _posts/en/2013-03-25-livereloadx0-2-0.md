[LiveReloadX](http://nitoyon.github.com/livereloadx/) 0.2.0 is released.

If you want to install, type `npm install -g livereloadx`. If you have installed older versions, run `npm update -g livereloadx`.

With older version, if you modifying any files under the monitored directory, browsers are reloaded. It means that running `git commit` made browsers reloaded.

So, I add a command line options to specify include/exclude filter.

For example, if you want to `cache` directory not to be watched, specify as follows:

```
$ livereloadx --exclude cache
```

And more, LiveReloadX 0.2.0 monitors files with extension such as html, shtml, css, js, jpg, gif, png, cgi, php... If you want to watch files with extension `ini`, run following:

```
$ livereloadx --include "*.ini"
```

Iinclude/exclude options works like rsync. See FILTER RULES section of rsync manual for details.

Try it now!!
