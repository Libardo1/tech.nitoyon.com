Yoshihiro Shindo has <a href="http://www.be-interactive.org/index.php?itemid=325">blogged about "Spark project" in English</a>.

"Spark project" is a Japanese OpenSource ActionScript Community. There are many awesome libraries such as:

ASReflect
:   `ASReflect` is a Java-like reflection library that wraps `flash.utils.describeType`.

E3Engine
:   An ECMAScript(3rd) engine written in ActionScript2. This engine enables us to execute `eval()` dynamically.

swfassist
:   `swiffassist` can dynamically generate SWF binaries on ActionScript3. This library may change the world!?

Thread
:   `Thread` helps us write asynchronous processing in ActionScript3. 

The details are given in <a href="http://www.be-interactive.org/index.php?itemid=325">his entry</a>. Let's check it now!
