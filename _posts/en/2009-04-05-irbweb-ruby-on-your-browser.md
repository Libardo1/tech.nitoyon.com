One of the annoyances of trying ruby is installing Ruby. IRBWEB let you try it on your browser!

You can enter ruby expression and evaluate it.

It works completely in your browser, so you get the result so quickly.

Requirements
============

The Silverlight 2.0 runtime plug-in required.

How does it work?
=================

Silverlight supports DLR(Dynamic Language Runtime) which enables us to execute Ruby and Python on .NET application. IRBWEB is developped based on repl sample included in <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sdlsdk">Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK</a> 0.5.0.
