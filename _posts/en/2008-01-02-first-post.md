This is my first post at this blog.

I've learned AS3 and Flex for 1 year, and writing AS3 blog in Japanese([here](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/nitoyon/)). And now, I decided to write in English. I want to show many AS3 samples on this blog.

I also want to introduce good libraries and tools developed by Japanese. Some Japanese have developed very nice libraries and tools, but I'm afraid most of them are not used world wide.

Nice to see you.
